PART I: CUSTOMISATION OF PROVISIONS IN THE GENERAL AGREEMENT
§1
Subject of Agreement
§ 1.1 Subject of Agreement:	[X] § 1.1 shall apply , or
[  ] § 1.1 shall apply, except that this General Agreement shall not apply to 	Individual Contracts in respect of which the Delivery Point is the National 	Balancing Point in the UK or the Zeebrugge Hub in Belgium.


§ 1.2 Pre-Existing Contracts:	[X] § 1.2 shall apply, or
[   ] § 1.2 shall not apply


§2
Definitions and Construction
§ 2.2 Inconsistencies:	The following sentence shall be added at the end of § 2.2:
“The evidence of an Individual Contract contained in any recorded telephone conversation(s) and in any undisputed Confirmation shall prevail over any other oral or written evidence. If there is any inconsistency between any recorded telephone conversation(s) and the terms of a Confirmation, the former shall prevail.”
§ 2.4 References to Time: 	time references shall be:	
[X] as provided in the General Agreement (CET), or
[   ] to the following time: 

§3
Concluding and Confirming Individual Contracts
§ 3.3 shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
“3. Issuing of Confirmations and Objections to Confirmations:

(a)	Unless otherwise agreed, the Seller shall send to the Buyer by facsimile a Confirmation recording the details of the Individual Contract within three (3) Business Days of an Individual Contract being concluded. I am changing this sentence.
(b)	If the Buyer is satisfied that the Confirmation accurately reflects the terms of the Individual Contract, the Buyer shall accept the Confirmation by signing it and returning it to the Seller within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Confirmation.
(c)	If the Buyer is not so satisfied, the Buyer shall inform the Seller of any inaccuracies within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Confirmation. If the Seller agrees that the Confirmation is inaccurate, the Seller shall issue a new Confirmation and §3.3 (a) and (b) shall apply in relation to the new Confirmation.
(d)	If the Buyer has not received a Confirmation from the Seller within three (3) Business Days of an Individual Contract having been concluded, the Buyer shall send to the Seller a Confirmation, and §3.3 (b) and (c) shall apply in relation to the Confirmation by replacing all references to “Buyer” with “Seller” and all references to “Seller” with “Buyer”.
(e)	Failure by either Party to send or return a Confirmation shall not: (i) affect the validity or enforceability of the Individual Contract; or (ii) constitute a failure to perform a material obligation under §10.5 (a).”

[Note - The EFET does not require either party to prepare a confirmation.  We believe that it is in both parties’ interests that they are charged with sending and responding to confirmations.]

§ 3.4 Authorised Persons:	[   ] § 3.4 shall apply to Party A and shall be as designated in Annex
______, or
[X] § 3.4 shall not apply to Party A 
[   ] § 3.4 shall apply to Party B and shall be as designated in Annex
______, or
[X] § 3.4 shall not apply to Party B
	

§5
Primary Obligations for Options

§ 5.3 Exercise of Option and Deadline:  
If in respect of an Individual Contract which provides for an Option no Exercise Deadline is specified:

[] the Exercise Deadline shall be as provided in § 5.3; or
[X] the Exercise Deadline shall be 1800 hours.


§7
Non-Performance Due to Force Majeure
§ 7.1 Definition of Force Majeure:

[X] § 7.1 shall apply as written in the General Agreement, or
[  ] § 7.1 shall not apply as written but instead shall be as follows: 

___________________________________________________.

§7.5 Long Term Force Majeure Limit:

§7.5 shall be deleted and replaced by the following:

“Where, in respect of an Individual Contract, the obligations of the Claiming Party have been adversely affected for longer than the Long Term Force Majeure Limit, then the Party which is not the Claiming Party shall have the right to terminate such Individual Contract forthwith by written notice to the Claiming Party. If more than one Individual Contract is adversely affected by Force Majeure, then a termination of one such Individual Contract shall terminate all such Individual Contracts. Upon such termination, each Party shall calculate, and notify to the other Party, the Termination Amount in respect of all such Individual Contracts  in accordance with §11.1 within three (3) Business Days of the termination date so notified (the “FM Termination Date”). The Termination Amount payable shall be equal to one half of the difference between the aggregate of the Settlement Amounts due to the Party with the higher aggregate Settlement Amount (“X”) and the aggregate of the Settlement Amounts due to the Party with the lower aggregate Settlement Amount (“Y”). Such Termination Amount shall be paid by Y to X within three (3) Business Days of the FM Termination Date.”

[Note – Our provision above (1) avoids “cherry-picking” by ensuring that if one FM affected transaction is terminated, then all such transactions terminate; (2) provides a mechanism (based on other industry standard master agreements) by which both parties calculate a termination payment for FM affected transactions (effectively the average of both parties’ calculations is taken to achieve a fair “mid-market” result).]

The definition of “Long Term Force Majeure Limit” is deleted and replaced with the following:

““Long Term Force Majeure Limit” means, with respect to an Individual Contract:

(i)	more than thirty (30) consecutive days; or

(ii)	more than sixty (60) days in aggregate, 

within the Total Supply Period (or, if the Total Supply Period exceeds 12 months, within any consecutive twelve (12) month period falling within the Total Supply Period);”.

[Note - The time limits set out above reflect those found in the standard Power EFET. Further, we have provided in the last two lines above for a rolling 12 month period instead of the “calendar year” approach set out in the EFET. Our approach avoids the arbitrary rule of setting the clock back to zero on 1 January each year, even though the limit may be close to being exceeded on that date.] 


§10
Term and Termination Rights

§ 10.2 Expiration Date:
[   ] § 10.2 shall apply and the Expiration Date shall be: _____________, or 
[X] § 10.2 shall apply and there shall be no Expiration Date.

§ 10.4 Automatic Termination:

[   ] §10.4 shall apply to Party A, with termination effective immediately, or

[X] §10.4 shall not apply to Party B


§10.4 shall apply to Party B, except that it shall apply only with respect to a Material Reason specified in §10.5(c)(iv) or, to the extent analogous thereto, §10.5(c)(viii), with termination effective immediately prior to the institution of the proceedings or presentation of the petition. 


§ 10.5(b) Cross Default and Acceleration:

[   ] § 10.5(b)(i) shall not apply to Party A
[X] § 10.5(b)(i) shall apply to Party B, as amended below, or 
[   ] § 10.5(b)(i) shall not apply to Party B

§ 10.5(b)(i) is amended by deleting from the penultimate line “, or becoming capable at such time of being declared,” and replacing such words with “due and payable under such agreements or instruments before it would otherwise have been”.

[X] § 10.5(b)(ii) shall apply to Party A, or 
[   ] § 10.5(b)(ii) shall not apply to Party A
[X] § 10.5(b)(ii) shall apply to Party B, or 
[   ] § 10.5(b)(ii) shall not apply to Party B


For the purposes of § 10.5(b)(i) and (ii) above, the Threshold Amount shall be: [To be Agreed by Credit]

For Party A: £20,000,000 (twenty million pounds sterling) or the equivalent in any other currency or currency unit. For the avoidance of doubt, such Threshold Amount shall apply only with respect to Party A’s Credit Support Provider; and
For Party B: £20,000,000 (twenty million pounds sterling) or the equivalent in any other currency or currency unit.

§ 10.5(c) Winding-up/ lnsolvency /Attachment:

[X] § 10.5(c) (iv) shall apply and the applicable time period is within fifteen (15) calendar days, except that for a proceeding or petition referred to in § 10.5(c)(iv) that has been instituted or presented by the Party itself or its Credit Support Provider or, as the case may be, its Controlling Party, the applicable time period is zero (0) calendar days; or
[   ] § 10.5(c) (iv) shall not apply

§ 10.5(d) Failure to Deliver or Accept:

[X] § 10.5(d) shall apply, or
[   ] § 10.5(d) shall not apply

§ 10.5 Other Material Reasons:	

[   ] Material Reasons shall be limited to those stated in the General Agreement, or 
[X] the additional Material Reason set out below shall apply to Party A.
[X] the additional Material Reason set out below shall apply to Party B.

“(f)	Default under Specified Transaction.  The Party, any Credit Support Provider of such Party or any applicable Controlling Party of such Party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Business Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate or act on its behalf).

For this purpose, “Specified Transaction” means any contract or transaction relating to an energy commodity (including an agreement with respect to the contract or transaction) existing at the date of this General Agreement or after that date entered into between one Party (or any Credit Support Provider or Controlling Party with respect to that Party) and the other Party (or any Credit Support Provider or Controlling Party with respect to that other Party) which: (i) relates to an energy commodity; and (ii) is a commodity forward or future, commodity option, commodity swap or other commodity transaction, including any grid or system trade, any contract for differences, or any other similar transaction.  For the purpose of this definition, “energy commodity” shall mean any tangible or intangible energy commodity of any type or description (including, without limitation, electric power, electric power capacity, natural gas, natural gas capacity, natural gas liquids, heating oil and other petroleum by-products or fuels, as well as certificates or allowances of any kind relating to greenhouse gas emissions, or certificates certifying the quality of electricity as being produced from renewable sources including but not limited to Renewable Obligations Certificates (ROCs), Levy Exemption Certificates (LECs), Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or other certificates).”

[Note - We believe that it is in both parties’ interests to include this provision, which permits either party to terminate this agreement if the other party defaults on another agreement between the two parties, such as ISDA, EFET Power, or other agreements. We have limited these transactions to energy and commodity contracts as these are the only products we trade.] 

§12
Limitation of Liability

[X] § 12 shall apply as written in the General Agreement, or
[   ] § 12 shall be amended or replaced in its entirety as follows:

[Note - We do not believe it appropriate that an individual master agreement can be assigned /novated without all master agreements between the parties also being assigned. If one master agreement may be assigned separately from the others, such cross-product/cross-agreement netting will be ineffective and will increase the credit risks on the non-transferring party.]

Annex 1 – Defined Terms


The definition of “Affiliate” is deleted and replaced with the following:

““Affiliate” means in relation to a Party, any entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by that Party, any entity that controls, directly or indirectly, that Party or any entity directly or indirectly under common control with such Party.  For this purpose, “control” of any entity means ownership of a majority of the voting power of the entity;”
The following definition is added:
““EURIBOR” means:
(a)	the applicable Screen Rate; or
(b)	(if no Screen Rate is available and the Payee does not specify another page or service displaying the appropriate rate) the arithmetic mean of the rates (rounded upwards to four decimal places) as supplied to the Payee at its request quoted by not less than two major banks in the Euro-zone interbank market to leading banks in the European interbank market,
in either case as of the relevant time on the relevant day in accordance with market practice in the European Interbank market for the offering of deposits in euro for one (1) month;”

The following definition is added:
““Screen Rate” means the percentage rate per annum interest rates for euro deposits offered in the euro-zone determined by the Banking Federation of the European Union for the relevant period, and displayed on Reuters page EURIBOR01.  If the agreed page is replaced or service ceases to be available, the Payee may specify another page or service displaying the appropriate rate.”




 
PART II: ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS TO THE GENERAL AGREEMENT

§4.1 Delivery and Acceptance and Net Scheduling Obligations:

Pursuant (and subject) to §4.1(b), the Parties shall Schedule the Contract Quantities on a net basis.

§ 8.6 Amounts Payable:

§ 8.6 shall be deleted and replaced by the following:
	
“Without prejudice to a Party’s entitlement to invoice sums due under this § 8 in accordance with § 13, any such sum may be invoiced hereunder at any time and the Party so invoiced shall be required to make payment thereof on or before the fifth (5th) Business Day after receipt of such invoice. ”

§11.3 Set-Off:

A new §11.3 Set-Off is added as follows:

“3.	Set-Off:  The Termination Amount payable to one Party (the “Payee”) by the other Party (the “Payer”) will, at the option of the Terminating Party, be reduced by its set-off against any amount(s) (the “Other Agreement Amount”) payable (whether at such time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the Payee to the Payer (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under any other agreement(s) between the Payee and the Payer or instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or executed by one Party to, or in favour of, the other Party (and the Other Agreement Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects to the extent it is so set-off). The Terminating Party will give notice to the other Party of any set-off effected under this provision.

For this purpose, either the Termination Amount or the Other Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by the Terminating Party into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such Party would be able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.

If an obligation is unascertained, the Terminating Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant Party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.

Nothing in this provision shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien or other right to which any Party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).”

[A new §22.3 Appointment of Process Agent is added as follows 

“§22.3 Appointment of Process Agent:
